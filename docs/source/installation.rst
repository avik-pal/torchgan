Installation
============

Follow the following instructions to set up `torchgan`.
`Torchgan` is tested and known to work on major `linux distrubutions`.
If you face any problem with other `operating systems` feel free to file an `issue`.
Since `torchgan` is under active development we would recommend users to install directly
from source.

Pip Installation

This is the simplest method.

.. code:: bash

   $ pip3 install torchgan

Conda Installation
------------------

Installing via `conda` is currently unavailable. It will be available once we are at `v0.1`

Install from Source
-------------------

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/torchgan/torchgan
   $ cd torchgan
   $ python setup.py install
